We live in a world where the only currency left is one of impact. 

Each human being receives 10 000 impact points when they are born. And every day of their lives, one more impact point it attributed to their digital bank account. 

We can use impact point to reward people for offering their services, but we cannot ask for points directly. 

Every individual has digital identity, that is connected with their impact account.

Example of Accounts

| identity | SBIP   | AIP  | Age  | Nation  |
| -------- | ------ | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| K04      | 10 000 | 3474 | 1999 | Georgia |
| Z91      | 14 000 | 240  | 2000 | Albania |
| P49      | 10 500 | 7908 | 1997 | Russia        |

**identity** is unique combination of letters and numbers.

**SBIP** are soul-bound impact point. These cannot be used, but there are ways to transforming them into AIP.

**AIP** accumulated Impact Points to be distributed and invested into valuable and promising projects. 

**Age** is being recorded, because some actions require you to reach certain threshold, as well as unique events are triggered when a person grows into certain age.

**Nation** can influence rules of IP usage, and various benefits as well. 

We reached a point of abundance, so having no impact points won't make you starve, be without education or health care. 

In our world, everything is for free. But the impact economy took off. Everybody has their mission in life. Either to distribute impact points well, or to focus on projects and activities that will help others, and in return, increase their impact score. 

Some people gather millions of impact points, before they start distributing. Many keep their balance around zero. Giving away their small amount of earned points every day, or a week. 

One of the first things we learn as children, is theory of impact. Descendant of Theory of Change and philosophy of doing good. 

Who is actually doing the most good? Who is making a progress on the most important problems?

There is no clear answer to these questions. It's a lens we use for looking at the world. It makes us think. We need to understand how given activity leads to solving a particular problem. How costly it is? How scalable? How much resources are already invested?

You see, for every individual, theory of impact will be different. There are good practices for developing and updating your TOI, but ultimately, all of us need to think deeply to find our niche. 

We are not super rich. Most of us have about thousand points we were born with. Under usual circumstances, children not allowed to use their ten thousands of IP, until they are 18-24 (depending on the nation), because they are soul-bound. 

We can use our accumulated points anytime. Even as young children. That means at age 10, if we didn't spent much, we can have more than 3 000 IP to spent. 

At 18, with proper thinking and investment, some of my friends accumulated as much as 20 000 impact points. Not counting SBIP.

From the age of 3, every year we work on our Theory of Impact, and yearly plan for distribution of AIPs.

Let me tell you a bit more about how IPs are earned and distributed. 

We have an decentralised app for managing our impact points, public plans and identity. Our scores are always public. 

Anybody can give their AIP to anybody else as a reward for service. People care about using their AIP well, and it's not easy to find the best use-case for AIP in this day and age. 

Most people will either support their local projects, as they have better intuition there, for what is actually creating value, or invest into public funds, that reward you for delegating your impact points to them by 10% yearly return, while awarding useful projects with your IPs along the way. 

Braver people invest directly into specific projects, they find promising and are under the radar of big funds. This has advantage of higher potential return, if the project ends up being impactful, or total loss of resources.

Some people think that leveraging impact points through investing is more impactful then direct rewards to individuals. And that it creates incentive structure for projects to be more ambitious and think globally. 

## Chapter 1

I went through the school and found K04 looking into his notes and making calculations. 

"Hey KeyFour, what are you up to?"

"Reevaluating my expectation as every day during this time slot. How is your art project going?" 

"I have received an investment of 4 000 SBIP."

"no way! :o", Zeten screamed uncontrollably. "How is that possible? Let me guess. Identity fund? ... no, Spirit Foundation"

"almost there"

"Telltale Sign Pedigree. You must be kidding."

"Yep.", Zeten took a deep breath. "I have received a scholarship for independent research. Cannot believe it myself. Would you mind pinching me?"

KeyFour doesn't hesitate. 

"Auch" ... "Thanks"

"What about your calculations?", Zeten asks curiously. 

"What will you do with the funding? Can I see your proposal?", KeyFour asks without hesitation.

"I have an idea for teaching mathematics through programming of equations."

:o :o :o

"Can I join you?"

KeyFour knows the opportunity when he sees one. Zeten thinks silently. Exactly as expected. 

"Of course. I was hoping to receive this reaction."

"Yes!!"

"Welcome on board"
