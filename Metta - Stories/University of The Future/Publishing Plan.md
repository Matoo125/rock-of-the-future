## Schedule

Basic idea is to publish 1 chapter weekly in foreseeable future. With proper planning this should not be that hard, and if I have extra time, I can draft ahead, work on world building, community building, or my programming projects.

| Chapter                      | Release Date      | Delay |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| [[0. Introduction]]                 | 28. January, 2023 | Week  |
| [[1. Chapter - Hello Planet Rock]] | 28. January, 2023 | Week  |
| [[2. Chapter - Take Every Bet]]       |       4. February, 2023            |       |
| [[3. Chapter]]            |        11. February, 2023           |       |

## Why Web Novel?
Reasons for publishing this as a web-novel are simple. This way I can get frequent feedback from many people. It's free and easy as writing a Word document. It will keep my motivation high, as I won't need to wait for year(s) to feel the reward of publishing.

## Platforms









Why
- Aesthetic - the comfort of the reader and potential reach. 
- Functional - WordPress will only contain vetted content, while Wiki Web version of this book will serve as a space for drafting and enviromental crafting. 
- Artistic - Each platform can provide a little bit different perspective, that can elevate overall story.
- Educational - Diversity of audience, means diversity of feedback. 
- Emotional - Exposure to more ideas and viewpoints.
- Personal - More friends for me :)
- [[Fundraising]]

Of course, there is cost of time invested into each of these platform. Luckily I'm sort of [[Union of Elders|wise elder]] when it comes to software. Each platform will be prioritised, time will be tracked  and results evaluated. Reasoning can be found in [[Promotion]].
