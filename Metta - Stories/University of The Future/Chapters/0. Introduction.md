[[Universe of Perfect Balance]] is a copy of our universe. Many things are the same, but some small changes in decision-making of individuals had a big impact on the structure of the society and environment.

This [[Book of Web Fiction]] is an experiment and exercise of developing fictional world. The greatest fictional stories humanity ever created are religions and modern corporations. My original desire was to make a startup. That will happen as well, but first I have decided to give this story a chance, as it evolved into ambitious project. This project is educational for me as well.

It is partly [[Rationalist Fiction]], where the main character explores the world and learns how it works. It’s a world full of hope, [positivity](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Positive_psychology),  [pragmatic](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pragmatism) thought, dedicated work toward [wisdom](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wisdom) and [liberation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Buddhist_paths_to_liberation).

Practice never stops. The story is inspired by the [[LitRPG]] genre of [web fiction](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Web_fiction). As part of the story, I will use [note-taking](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Note-taking) and productivity systems to create a realistic model of “[improving skills](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lifelong_learning)” (aka leveling up). With a slightly [gamified](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gamification) spin. Inspired by many modern productivity systems and approaches.

The world is realistic and contemporary. Everything has an explanation. Even though it might not be clear from the start. The process of writing is full of surprises and improvements. The world is being developed with every word I write, while doing mundane activities, sports, or speaking with people on the street. 

Each chapter will include poetry and links to the internet. 

The fictional duplicate of our planet was named [[The Planet Rock]]. There are 4 major governments left, as well as many interesting educational institutions, religions, global communities, and organisations. 

Let the story begin.
Wish you a nice reading experience,
Matej
