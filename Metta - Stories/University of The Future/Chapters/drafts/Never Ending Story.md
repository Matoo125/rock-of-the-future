Love is near
Touch of dreams
People sleep
Everyone

I'm calm
Healthy mind
Energy body
Trusting soul

Hidden *secret* of unknown folks
Camera is *prepared* for you to host 
*My friend, I'm already a ghost*
Fear no more
Quiet prose
*Dose of hope*

Patient and slow
Determined to glow
Grow more and flow 
as falling snow
Forest folks

My new home contains
All colours
No phone
No frown
Anticipation of lucid show.
Open window
Open doors

Dove flew in
Say no more.
Dove flew in
Say no more.

Hope came in
Give no less.
Quick and steady
My life-plan, soon will be ready

Slow down a bit
Pretty, please.
It's time change it, 
Photo - freeze
Meal
Vegan - cheese
heals
Update - feeds
greece
Asian, nerds and geeks.
Mountain peeks
Art is neat
[[Wiki Leaks]].

Lucid nights and day dreams
Do all you can
To avoid vicious schemes
Living feels
Precious is the one who heals

Pressure lifting atmosphere
Energy of streets
And images of things
Internet streamed 
Down from space and hills

What a connection
Conference of ideas
No need for description 
Medication prescription

For sore throat
Take golden juice

Advantage and pain of shoes
One shot, and dead is goose.
Living with a [[Matrix Muse]]

Below the ground the ice is artic
Fabrication life beat
Shield of trees
Peek of hills
Omnipotent thrills
Open your mind and see how it feels

Deep dreem hidden scheme
Therapeutic gist
Under my first hit
Mediation in my sleep

Temporary study of flows
Column of ghosts
Streets are my home
Dopaminogenic hope
Better tomorrow
Beautiful glow

Developing heartbeat
Meditation and healed feelings
Skills of works in art group
Score here no more

End of show
Now talk slow
Bow
Eating from empty bowl

Fast and slow
Glow of town
Bow
End of show

When D9 left his room, a thought arose in his head. What if I never go to the university? 

What if I just meditate to the mountains? The idea wasn't it bad and D9 have decided to meditate on it. He went on the balcony, sat down, and closed his eyes. Dhamma, Buddha and Sangha. May all beings be happy. May we connect together. May we be happy and free of pain. Free of mental suffering. 

After finishing his prayer and meditation, he decided it's time to go. Quickly packet, on the last minute as always and said his goodbyes. 

Won't you eat?, Mom asked

Maybe later, fasting today

Again?

Only till afternoon

Okay, do you want some snacks?

Sure, nuts are great

And with that, he was gone.

The University of the Future is a good place to be. Established just 70 years ago, it's a very recent development. 

I was lucky enough to receive scholarship, thanks to be enterpreneurial efforts and programming skills. 

I have chosen this place above other alternatives.
- University of Wisdom
- University of Scholarship
- University of Applied Sciences

Why have I done so? Well
