## **Part 2:** Wise Sage of Trust

Let me introduce myself. My name is **[[D8]]** and I'm from the [[Anarchic Athens]]. I'm supporter of recent efforts of rebranding it into [[Digiland]]. 

I'm practitioner of martial arts, member of [[wisdom of arts and sciences]] from early age. Most of my experience is around technology and movement building. I have recently started to engage in international projects.

I have found the efforts of engaging with [[Union of Elders]] and other mentors extremely fruitful, for my recent development. As they say, the brain develops until 25, at least. But as [[Comenius]] said, education is a continuous lifetime effort.

Children love to play, compete and build social structures. I have been using all my powers to never stay too far behind in any particular area of life that I consider important.

In a few weeks, I will start attending [[Future University|University of the Future]]. One of my professors will be movement leader of [[Equilibriist]]. Political party from the [[Spirit Land of Aztecs]].

[[Equilibriist]] are currently well represented in all the [[4 World Powers|World Fractions]]. Surprisingly, they achieved the biggest success in the [[Anarchic Athens]]. Where the leading blockchain association [[Open Data]] is the company of their making.

My ambition is to join their structures in the land of their origin. Later to become involved in the political and social affairs. Once my studies are finished and I have gained sufficient experience and expertise in the matter.

It's dark outside and I have been working all day. Back in the routine I have learned to love the most. 

One needs to choose their priorities, as [[Union of Elders|elders]] tend to say. *Now it's time to do the work*.

Letter to the [[Wise Sage of Trust]] foundation.
With love, energy and good wishes,
M8.

## **Part 3**:  **World as we know it.**

Accepting death was something that happened to me at a young age. My initial meditations on the nature of consciousness happened around age of 5 or 6. 

- How is it possible that there is something rather than nothing?

Despite listening to various argument, none of them convinced me fully. I could believe it for a little while, but soon my own reasoning would figure out strong counterarguments. Most of the explanation are incomplete. So they don't explain the real thing, only the simplified concept we can hold in our minds. 

We don't know what happens after we die. Despite what we can hear from various directions. We can imagine and speculate, but in the end all that matters is how well we lived our lives and prepared for the last moment. 

I have created my first plan for reaching perfect death when I was about 16 and improved it ever since. Possibly even earlier, but memory of my childhood and adolescence is not great. To be honest, my memory was never very detailed. But I remember all my insights and I have developed, tested and integrated various mechanism for keeping track of every useful experience in one way or another. 

When I'm not afraid of death, how can I be afraid to live? Impossible, and here I am afraid of the spiders. Not really afraid anymore as I got older, but still I don't play with them as with animals I truly enjoy. What makes me like this? I'm I still under the influence of my childhood memories and fears?

Here I'm ready to bet everything on a story about physics, technological advancement, science, art, poetry, [[metta]] meditation, world development, and well, multiverse. 

*Letter to the [[Church of Mathematical Divine]].

## **Part 4 :Let there be darkness, Let there be light**

My daily prayer practice is finished, and now it's time to meditate a bit. I close my eyes and feel the sensations in my body. Finally getting deep into the peacefulness of my own being. 

*Knock, knock*

*"Who is there?"* I ask. 

*"Hey [[M8]], how is life?"*, my sister **[[A5]]** comes into the room.

*"Have you finished your studies?"*, I reply.

*"Of course I did, so please answer my question."*, A5 requested with a interest in her face. 

She was always a great sister. Youngest of the 4 siblings. Popular at her high-school and overall a briliant student. Many people can can perform well during high-school, but in several subjects, she might reach excellence, even in the real life. 

I love my family, they are all great and inspiring people. Who knows where would I be without my siblings. I have received a lot of useful advice, support and mentorship from my older brother and sister. Now they are both far away. Studying and working on exciting projects. 

I aspire to be like them, but better. And our youngest sister will show us all one day. We support ambition in our family, as well as care and kindness. Each of of us is member of a different religious movement and soon, we will be separated on every continent of [[The Planet Rock]]. 

*"What are you thinking about?"*, A5 asks.

**"Well not much, just the uni, projects and stuff",** I reply quietly. 

*"Do you want to talk about it?"*, caring inquisition continues

*"Sure"*, I say honestly

My sister was always good at asking questions. It's her natural talent. I have learned a lot from here. Now I know it's always better to engage in conversation and be honest. 

D8: *"When I go to the University of the Future, we will all be in different countries. All around the planet Rock."*

A5: *"Is it a bad, or a good thing?"*

D8: *"I think, it's both. We will learn more about the **peaceful balance** this way. We will become true family of the **Rock**. As international as it can get. But what if we lose ourselves in the process? What if we lose the connection, we have developed?"*

A5: *"Look M8, you have been always the most caring person I know. I know the separation will be hard, I hate it myself. But remember what happened when K9 left, she kept in touch every single day."*

D8: *"But then she stopped."*

A5: *"We are still in touch weekly, she took on many new responsibilities, and become leader of a student organisation. You know she always appreciates, when we call her. She never left us, the same as with **[[Z9]]**."*

D8: *"Yes, you are right. Please always remember, that I'm here for you if you need something, or just want to talk. Even if I .."*

A5: *"Yes I will remember. We are in touch, as if you never left. "*

D8: *"Thanks sis. Much appreciated"*

*"First year, startin soon, hah?"*, A5 continues

D8: *"Yes, yes."*

A5: *"And I expect you have been sleeping well all night, instead of sending letters and applications into all directions?"*

D8: *"Well, you know me better, than I do myself. I did slept 4 hours, though."*

A5: *"Wow"*

D8: *"Yeah"*

A5: *"Any highlights?"*

D8: *"I have messaged to the Math Church and Sage's Trust."*

A5: *"Good."*

D8: *"How was your evening?"*

A5: *"I have read [[Book of Arts]], then meditated in my sleep"*

D8: *"Of course, you did. Any new insights?"*

My sister took 3 deep breaths, closed her eyes and started speaking:
*"Life is short, and dark is night
Our light can shine to change the vibe
Smile so wide, it made me cry
Taken by the wind to fly high"*

She replied in a verse. 

Latest hobby of my younger sister is the practice of [[Dream Yoga]]. She picked it up quickly, and became the best sleep practicioner in our family. Now everyone is trying to catch up. 

*"Do you have anything?",* she asks.

*"Love of god, many in one
Moon connects us through the sky
Clouds are misty, time is fast
Lost in now, welcome inside"*, I replied

We have started speaking in verses, when A5 was about 5 years old. Her poetry was natural, deep and touching. Later she learned to speak in prose as well. But some of our experiences, as for example those of rituals, prayers, meditations and dreams, are easiest to express in verses. 

*Beep, beep, beep*

My alarm goes up. It's time to go. Time to say goodbye.
