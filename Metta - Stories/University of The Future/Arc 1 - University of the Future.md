Welcome to the [[Arc 1 - University of the Future]]. Futuristic [[Book of Web Fiction]] from the [[Alternative Universe]]. Full of realistic and magical experiences. Story of hope, perseverance, and drive to succeed. 

Book can be read on [[1. Chapter - Hello Planet Rock|here]] or [WordPress](https://futureuniversitypress.wordpress.com/) blog. Help me to develop this world by filling the [Introductory World-Building Exercise](https://forms.gle/UGz7nLj3vMVvpnFD9)

Final chapters will be published weekly on [[WordPress]]. 
- If you want to save your time and only read completed work, I recommend reading it there. 
- If you want to wait until the story part is completed, I recommend waiting for at least 3 months, or a year.

[[Publishing Plan]] goes into more details. Jump in directly to the [[1. Chapter - Hello Planet Rock]] or [[0. Introduction]].
