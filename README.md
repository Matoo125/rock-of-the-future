# Rock of the Future

Rock of the Future is open-source platform for world-building and story development.

To get started you will need to install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (you won't need any pro feature)

Close this repository. If you have never done that, you can follow this [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). 

It's necessary to have [git installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your computer and Github Account.

After you clone the repository and have it in your desktop folder, you can open it as Obsidian Valut. 

We are using github as our shared backup and data storage. [Read here](https://obsidian.rocks/backing-up-your-obsidian-vault-on-github-for-free/) for more details about how it works.

There are many public obsidian valuts on Github. You can find them [here](https://github.com/topics/obsidian-vault), for example. If you are curious about the tool itself.
