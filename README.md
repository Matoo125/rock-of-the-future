Rock of the Future is open-source platform for world-building and story development.

*Note: If you are not familiar with how Git works, this process might be overwhelming. I'm happy to personally help anyone to get started.*

To get started you will need 
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) text editor 
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) command line tool
- Github Account.

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository and then  [clone it](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). 

After you clone the repository and have it in your desktop folder, you can open it as Obsidian Valut. 

We are using github as our shared backup and data storage. [Read here](https://obsidian.rocks/backing-up-your-obsidian-vault-on-github-for-free/) for more details about how it works. There are many public obsidian valuts on Github. You can find them [here](https://github.com/topics/obsidian-vault), for example. If you are curious about the tool itself.

Install Obsidian Git extension from the community store. You can setup automatic backup, or use quick commands to [push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) your changes. With this extension installed all you need to do is to 1) open command palette (command+p) and 2) search for `Git: Create Backup`, which will stage, commit and push our changes to github.

Next step is to create [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) with your changes. I'm happy to share access to the repository to anyone interested, and we can work on Branches instead of Forks.
