find solution for naming things.

Probably some collaborative software, voting, or forecasting.

For example name for the main project.

Options
- Metta Universe Collective
- Metta Fiction Collective
- Collaborative Universe Metta Collective
- Stories of Metta Universe
- Metta Webfic Collective
- Metta Stories Collective

We could create format of "label"+"activity"+"social structure". 
- What is the best label? could be any word
- What is our core activity?
- What kind of group of people we are?

Last one is the easiest to answer for me, as collective seems to be good enough. 

Core activity of what we do in [[Elements of Perfect Balance]] and [[Metta - Stories]] is development of webstories. 

**Metta Stories Collective** is winner for now.
