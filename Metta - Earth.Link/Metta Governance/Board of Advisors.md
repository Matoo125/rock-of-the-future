Welcome to the Advisors page. **The University of The Future** is a book of fiction. We want it to be realistic and educational at the same time. That's why we are building **The Board of Advisors**, which will play the role of translation between the real world we have here on planet Earth, and the fictional world of **Balanced Effort**, which is an almost exact copy of our planet. With slight historical alterations in decision-making.

There are 3 pathways to becoming **Advisor** for the story.

1.  **Direct Invitation** - I will be inviting people, who I consider inspiring, and I think their input will make the story better, or more accurate.
2.  **Apply for Advisor role -** anyone can apply for the role of an advisor. I'll be evaluating applications regularly on a weekly basis, at most.
3.  **Recommend Advisor** - If you know the right person, to become an advisor for the story, you can use **this form**. Or send them a link to this page.

We expect this book to have at least 100 advisors. It won't happen fast. This project is expected to take 3-24 months. Depending on my other responsibilities.
