> Also known as "webfiction" or the "online novel", web serial novels are the prose equivalent of [Webcomics](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Webcomics "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Webcomics") which happen to have distinct [Story Arcs](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc"). An author, usually an amateur, publishes a [novel](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novel "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novel") in many short installments (often daily or weekly) on a website.
