There are many religious organisations and movements within [[The Planet Rock]]. Almost everyone is part of one or more such communities. Religions are well-respected for the social and spiritual support they provide to the people. 

Almost all religious projects are donation-based non-profit projects. Leaders live humble lives, despite having large following of people who would be happy to gift them premium worldly possessions. 

[[D8]] and part of his family are a bit more spiritual than average population. It's part of a day to day life.
