Project of [[Metta - Collective]]

God created universe in 7 days. It's not perfect, but much better than one would expect after a week of work. 

Luckily we have much more time. Our mission is to develop [[Collaborative Work of Fiction]]. 

[[Elements of Perfect Balance]] lists all the building blocks of the universe. 

You are invited to improve it and propose new ideas, fill missing elements.
