Welcome to the website of [[Anarchic Athens]]. One of the [[The Planet Rock|four leading powers]] in the [[Universe of Perfect Balance]]. 

We are here to serve our people through efficient means of technology, decision-making structures and provision of opportunities for all generations. 

## Governance

We use online forums, git-software, [[We Web World]], [[Elections Distributed]], [[Tax Collector]], etc.

How governance works in this country?

We use a lot of on-chain decision-making mechanisms. Our [[National Blockchain Agency]] is responsible for the quality, safety and stability of our data and UX. As well as [[transparency of governance]] processes, [[documentation of decision-making]], and [[open source code]].
