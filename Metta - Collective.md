Welcome to the [[Metta - Collective]]

We are an open story development collective for creating better futures.

[[Join Us]]

Our mission is to develop [[crowd-sourced]] visionary worlds, and translate the best ideas we have today into engaging stories. 

We plan to achieve this with following projects
1. [[Metta - The Universe]]
2. [[Metta - Stories]]
3. [[Metta - Earth.Link]]

Later we will launch [[Metta - Games]]. Where best stories will be translated into interactive games. 

This project is in public domain and anyone can contribute to it.
